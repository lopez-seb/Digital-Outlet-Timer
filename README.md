# Base level firmware of the Digital Outlet Timer Project

The firmware contains known bugs, but is functional.

At the time of this README, the device using the firmware must be reset when the **RUN PROGRAM** state has been engaged. That is, there is no escape sequence yet 
  to take the user back to the main menu.
  
The JSON file is for anyone using this code to simulate it on WOKWI
